                  'A 4-year-old girl is brought to the pediatric clinic by her mother who reports that her daughter has decreased appetite, lethargy, and an enlarging belly. Physical examination reveals a large, firm, irregular, non-tender mass in the child’s abdomen. A CT-guided biopsy reveals neoplastic “small blue cells with zen ball pattern.” The child’s neoplasm is removed and the surgical specimen is shown in the image. What is your diagnosis?',
